The datasets are included in the /datasets folder in my submission, but their original links can be found here:

1. Graduate Admissions (Admission)

2. Celebrity Attractiveness (CelebA)

I used python 2.7.9 to run all of the algorithms along with scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib.
To run any of the algorithms, run the command
>>> $ python AP_DecisionTree.py
for the appropriate dataset/algorithm.
